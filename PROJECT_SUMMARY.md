## 🎯 Business Logic Implemented

### Investment Flow
1. Investor browses campaigns
2. Selects campaign and enters amount
3. System validates investment:
   - Campaign must be active
   - Amount must not exceed remaining goal
   - User must be an investor
4. Investment is created
5. Campaign funding is updated
6. Campaign status changes to "funded" if goal reached

### Campaign Management
1. Restaurant owner creates restaurant profile
2. Owner creates campaign with terms
3. Campaign becomes active
4. Funding progress tracked in real-time
5. Campaign closes when:
   - Funding goal reached (status: funded)
   - End date reached (status: closed)
   - Owner manually closes (status: closed)

## 📈 Scalability Considerations
